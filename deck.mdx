Kubernetes RBAC

---

## Where Are We Now?
- Sysdig
- Datadog
- ELK

---

## Why Are We Moving To RBAC?

- Poka Yoke (Safety Bumpers)
- Security
- ~~Checkboxes~~ Compliance

```notes
compare ns: 'private' in python vs 'private' in ruby
- deploying stuff to the wrong place
```

---

## Security
- Brian can sleep easier
- Customers can sleep easier
- Oncall can sleep easier

---

## What Is RBAC Composed of?
- `rbac.authorization.k8s.io`
  - Roles, ClusterRoles
  - RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings

```notes
- Can be NS specific, or Cluster wide
```

---

## What Is A Role?
- List o' permissions
- Default DENY
- Additive

```notes
- Roles grant permission to k8s api objects
```
---

## Example Role

Read pods in a NS:
```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

```notes
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-examples
```
---

## Example Role That's Useful

`Tom opens a terminal up. Joy.`

---

## What Is a Role Binding?
- Mapping between subject and role

```notes
- Bindings map roles and accounts (subjects)
```

---

## Example Role Binding

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

```notes
see the kubernetes.io docs above for link
talk about users vs service accounts
```

---

## Will I Have To Write My Own?

Maybe.
I have examples!
kubernetes.io has more examples!

```notes
Depends on your service. If you modify k8s objects, yes.
```
